This repository contains all notes and resources from taking CS 160a at Community College of San Francisco taught by Gregory Boyd.

I have broken the course up by week and created a directory to contain a markdown README the summarizes all notes and includes additions to the notes from outside studying related to the topics covered.

Additional information on the course can be found on the course website: http://fog.ccsf.edu/~gboyd/cs160a/Syllabus.html
